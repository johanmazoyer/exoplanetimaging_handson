Search and Characterization of Exoplanets — November 22-26, 2021, Paris Observatory - PSL - Mines de Paris
Hands-on sessions tutorial
Johan Mazoyer - Elsa Ducrot - Florian Philipot - Flavien Kiefer

This document will help you install the python tools for the hands on sessions  (afternoons of Tuesday - Wednesday - Thursday) for the exoplanet class. We would really appreciate for you to at least try before Monday to install those on your computer. 

We will hold a session on Monday evening from 4.30 to 5 to help those who could not install those packages on their computer. Even if you do not have a personal laptop or if we cannot find a way to install the packages on your laptop (or even if you never heard of python), please come, the hands on sessions can be followed by all and you’ll have a chance to see real astronomical data and how astronomers work.

The installation will require you to use the command line to create python environments, install some packages and use jupyter notebooks. A virtual environment is a Python tool for project isolation. They allow Python site packages (third party libraries) to be installed locally in an isolated directory for a particular project, as opposed to being installed globally (i.e. as part of a system-wide Python). The main reason we need you to create specific environment is that you all have different OSs and python versions. The packages that we ask you to install have often be coded by astronomers with limited computer science skills and they are not super stable : they might not work if you do not have the proper version of python, or they might not work if installed with other packages. For this reason, we install them in their own little box, a controlled environment with a specific version of python and a specific set of packages. You can easily remove everything at the end of the class.


For those on windows I think the main problem I encountered tonight with you was an error of this type: 
"error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required. Get it with "Microsoft C++ Build Tools": https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ "
This will likely solve it:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64261546/python-cant-install-packages !


Guidelines:

1. Click on this link, click on download to obtain astrophysical data for the class and unzip it.
 https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ljys3kuk19krthy/AADJFZz8lcEBlZd_e-nmdwl1a?dl=1
 

2. Download and install miniconda. Anaconda is a distribution of the Python programming language, that aims to simplify package management and deployment and that is available for all OSs.
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

3. Installation of virtual environnements and packages

This will require that you type a few lines of code in the terminal of your computer. 

Note: Windows users can run into issues here because Windows is not Linux-based. You might want to install Windows Subsystem for Linux
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about
that installs an a GNU/Linux environment directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.


3.1 Radial Velocity Hands-on (Second day)

3.1.1 create a virtual environment:

> conda create -n exoplanet_RV_env python=3.8
type 'y' if/when asked to

3.1.2 Activate your environment

> conda activate exoplanet_RV_env

3.1.3 Install the required packages

> pip3 install matplotlib
> pip3 install scipy
> pip3 install pandas
> pip3 install astropy
> pip3 install datetime
> pip3 install jupyterlab
> pip3 install corner
> pip3 install --pre astroquery
> pip3 install --extra-index-url https://dace.unige.ch/api python-dace-client
> pip3 install --extra-index-url https://obswww.unige.ch/~delisle -Iv spleaf==0.1.5
> pip3 install --extra-index-url https://obswww.unige.ch/~delisle -Iv kepderiv==0.1.1

3.1.4. Navigate to the folder where the material of the Hands-on session is stored 
> cd DirectoryWhereYouDownloadedTheDataOnYourComputer/
> cd PSL_exoplanet_handson/
> cd radial_velocity_hands_on/

3.1.5. Open the jupyter lab
> jupyter lab

This should open a window in your browser. You can now double click on the notebook
Your now ready for this class !

3.2 Transits Hands-on (Third day)

3.2.1 create a virtual environment:

> conda create -n exoplanet_transits_env python=3.8
type 'y' if/when asked to

3.2.2 Activate your environment

> conda activate exoplanet_transits_env

3.2.3 Install the required packages

> pip3 install matplotlib
> pip3 install corner
> pip3 install jupyterlab
> pip3 install batman-package
> python3 -m pip install -U "exoplanet[extras]"

3.2.4. Navigate to the folder where the material of the Hands-on session is stored 
> cd DirectoryWhereYouDownloadedTheDataOnYourComputer/
> cd PSL_exoplanet_handson/
> cd transit_hands_on/

3.2.5. Open the jupyter lab
> jupyter lab

This should open a window in your browser. You can now double click on the notebook
Your now ready for this class !

3.3 Imaging Hands-on (Fourth day)

WINDOWS Users : For one of the packages : you will need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about
One of the packages we need in the last part (Obitize) require a package (Rebound), which cannot be installed on windows without WSL  https://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~schaefer/teach/f/how_to_install_rebound_on_win10.pdf

If you do not want to install Windows Subsystem for Linux, you'll only be able to run the first 2 parts of the notebook. 


install ds9 : https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9
to look at images

3.3.1 create a virtual environment:
> conda create -n exoplanet_imaging_env python=3.8
type 'y' if/when asked to

3.3.2 Activate your environment
> conda activate exoplanet_imaging_env
> conda install git

3.3.3 Install the required packages

> pip3 install matplotlib
> pip3 install ipywidgets
> pip3 install corner
> pip3 install jupyterlab
> pip3 install git+https://bitbucket.org/pyKLIP/pyklip.git
> pip3 install git+https://github.com/willvousden/ptemcee.git
> pip3 install cython
> pip3 install orbitize

3.3.4. Navigate to the folder where the material of the Hands-on session is stored 
> cd DirectoryWhereYouDownloadedTheDataOnYourComputer/
> cd PSL_exoplanet_handson/
> cd imaging_hands_on/

3.3.5. Open the jupyter lab
> jupyter lab

This should open a window in your browser. You can now double click on the notebook
Your now ready for this class !

4. The last day of the class, you can remove all virtual environnements easily :
> conda env remove --name exoplanet_RV_env
> conda env remove --name exoplanet_transits_env
> conda env remove --name exoplanet_imaging_env

And uninstall miniconda if you wish to.
